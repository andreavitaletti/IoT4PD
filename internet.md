# Internet

Well, to understand the Internet of Things, we have to understand the Internet.

The [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. 

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP is the suite of communications protocols used to connect hosts on the Internet. TCP/IP uses several protocols, the main ones are TCP and IP.

### Internet Protocol 

IP specifies the format of packets, also called datagrams, and the addressing scheme.

IP is connectionless, namely each message is divided into packets. Each packet includes complete addressing information. The packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery. Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers.

### Transmission Control Protocol 

Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.

## Addressing

Each resource over the Internet is identified by a Unique Address
